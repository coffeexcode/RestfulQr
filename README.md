<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
RestfulQR is a simple REST API to create and serve QR codes as part of a microservices architecture. The project uses
the [QRCoder](https://github.com/codebude/QRCoder) library to create QR codes. The project aims to serve all functionality
available in QRCoder via REST calls. 


### Built With

* [QRCoder](https://github.com/codebude/QRCoder)
* [.NET 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
* [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-5.0)
* [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [Seq](https://datalust.co/seq)
* [Docker (docker-compose)](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need Docker installed in order to run the project via docker-compose.
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed in order to run the project via `docker-compose`.
* Atleast [.NET 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) installed to debug and run via `dotnet`
* _Optional: Visual Studo 2019_

### AWS
RestfulQr uses S3 to persist images. You will need to create a S3 bucket to use. Once you create the bucket, you need to configure the
appSettings.json file with your values.

For example,
```json
  "AWS": {
    "Profile": "your-profile",
    "Region": "your-region",
    "ProfilesLocation": "your-aws-credentials"
  },
  "S3": {
    "BucketName": "your-bucket-name"
  }
```

You will also need to set bind your docker containers with the right volume for your credentials in `docker-compose.override.yml`
### Installation & Starting

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/coffeexcode/RestfulQr.git
   ```
2. Start via `docker-compose`
   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This project is meant to be incredibly simple to use if you are familiar with REST. For testing and development, the
recommended tool is [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). 

_Note: These steps assume that you are running locally with the default URL settings. This implies the application is running at_ http://localhost:14000


You can generate a retrieve your first QR code using the following steps:

1. Ensure the project is running via `docker-compose`
    ```sh
    docker-compose up
    ```
2. Get an API key.

     _Note: If you are running in development, you can skip this step and replace the api key with 'development' for future steps._

    ```sh
    curl --location --request POST 'https://localhost:14000/api/v1/apikey'
    ```
3. Use the API key to generate a simple QR code from JSON data with default settings.
    ```sh
    curl --location --request POST 'https://localhost:14000/api/v1/qrcode/json' \
    --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR-API-KEY-GOES-HERE' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
    "demo": "test"
    }'
    ```

    If the request was successfully, you should get a 201 CREATED response with a body like the following:
    ```json
    {
        "succeeded": true,
        "errors": null,
        "createdQrCode": {
            "filename": "3bc3d64e-05b8-4af5-a106-dcaff7815bd3.png",
            "created": "2020-12-03T12:53:09.1174748+00:00",
            "createdBy": "YOUR-API-KEY-GOES-HERE"
        },
        "data": {
            "demo": "test"
        }
    }
    ```
4. Retrieve your QR code! Pass the filename from step #3 into the URL of the following
    ```sh
    curl --location --request GET 'https://localhost:14000/images/3bc3d64e-05b8-4af5-a106-dcaff7815bd3.png' \
    --header 'X-Api-Key: development'
    ```

## Help
RestfulQR has swagger built in. While running in development, you can browse to http://localhost:14000/swagger/index.html to view 
the swagger definintion and examples of using all of the endpoints available.
